​	This is my first time writing a diary.The reason is that I was watching one of my favorite up,Zhu Zhiwen.During his global cycling trip to the United States,he was invited to the home of the CEO of one the world's top 500 companies,Cisco's CEO Jan M. Gronski.During the discussion,the 74-year-old gentleman,a polyglat fluent in seven languages,shared his method of learning foreign languages:he diligently writes a diary in a foreign language every day,not needing much,I most like the phrase he said:"Practice makes perfect".So I want to try writing something every day,some thoughts and reflections,as well as recording interesing interesting events.

​	Although it's already 1:30AM on the second day,I still want to record some things.Of course,first of all,I want to praise Markdown,which I've been using recenthly for note-taking.To be honest,I really feel like Ishould have started using Markdown sooner.At first,I thought taking notes was a foolish thing to do because I believed accessing information nowadays is straightforward,and note-taking seemed like a waste of time.However,after I started using Markdown for note-taking,I realized I was wrong.When I'm taking notes,it's a process of organizing my thoughts and enhancing my memory.During this process,it's easy to discover those areas where I thought I understood something but actually didn't.Another point is that when you revisit your notes and find them unclear or difficult to understand,you can continuously refine them.This way,you can achieve a deeper understanding of the subjuct matter.Notes,like people,become stronger as long as you continuously improve upon then existing foundation.

​		Indeed,it's a promising start😼.

​	Writing a diary to learn a foreign language is indeed a very effecive method，as discovered yesterday.Today，I watched"Catch Me If Can" and gained some insights.Appearance and demeanor are crucial;if you want others to believe in you ,you must first believe in yourself.

​	And then,today I had anoter argument with my girlfriend.The reason for our argument was that she anevies other couples who can spend all day together,while the time we spend together is very limited.I found that the best way to resolve it is through companionship and listening,rather than insisting on expressing my own views.

​	The most important thing in learning is perseverance,while also taking care to rest orpperly.

​	One step at a time,take it slow.To be honest,I still feel like I know too little.Managing time is an art.It's easy to spend time on things that don't contribute to self-improvement.First of all,there is the arrangement of English.It means completing basic English learning by November.Then it involves reading some English books on subjects like management.

​	Lastly,it's important to ansure good rest, and to set a 25-minute alarm before using elextronic devices.

​	Keep up the good work tomorrow too😘 .

I haven't written in my diary for a few days. I've been busy resetting my computer. Resetting the computer is more effective for cleaning than just deleting software from it. It allows you to approach things with a fresh perspective and discover something more interesting.  It's like discovering a new scripting a new scripting language like AutoHotkey, for example. And when it comes to learing, ChatGPT really comes in handy. So, I just need to know the part that fulfills my own needs.

​	Last night, I prepared for the exam for a long time, includeing various methods like this and that. I kept at it, including drictly studying Java, making cheat sheets, and figuring out ways to bypass USB restrictions and network limitations. But when it came time for the exam. I realized all my worries were unnecessary. Why do I say thar? Because cheating turned out to be so easy. It really is just a matter of copy and paste. But I've spent a lot of time and effort on these meaningless things. It's like the ship naturally steers to the bridgehead, really without excessive worry about the future,seizing every exciting moment now. 

​	I've realizede that  I've truly come a long way. Another significant issue is the control of time.  Here, it refers to maintaining a routine of stopping to rest every 25 minuter when using electronic devices. This can really adjust one's state to a very comfortavle condition.

​	These past few days after the bacation, a lot has happened. I've also gained a lot of insights during this time, making me ponder where to begin sharing them. Firstly, my relationship with my girlfriend has reached a new level; indeed,addressing issues promptly rather than bottling them up is crucial. If you can articulate the problems in conctete language, it often means that you've already solved half of them. And then there's the matter of friendship. Being able to make true friends is truly a stroke of luck. Friendship isn't about quantity but quality. Invest your time in people who bring meaning to your life. I used to argue with my parents a lot before, but now I really understand--they're just getting older, that's all. Thinking this way makes me realize that many things really aren't worth getting worked up over. Arguing with them has truly become a meaningless thing.

​	It seems that when my energy wanes, I find it difficult to manage my time effectively and start fell overwhelmed. A person's energy is limited each day, so allocating it wisely becomes an art. The idea is simple: set an end time for a task before you start it.	

The older you get, the more you see; everyone has their own calculations to make. It's difficult to put into words this kind of felling. What's the use of seeing through it all? It just adds the troubles. There's no point in getting caught up in this kind of suspicion. Leaving this environment is probably the best choice. The environment can't be changed,  and there's no need to. Time should be spent on things that are worthwhile.

​	On my way to the township government today. I unexpectedly encountered a snake.	 It was truly absurd. When I first set out. the black snake was right by the roadside, next to some bushes. When I passed by again after picking up my package, I found that it had returned to the same spot. It seemed like it was either hunting or just warming itself on the road. Looking back, I still feel a bit scared. In the future, I should keep a safe distance from the bushes by the roadside.

​	If one's own strength is strong enough, then it is the inner driving force thar is pushing  up the self-promotion. At this time, it is not that we encounter life, but that was take the initiative to face challenges. Yet some prople's logic is wrong at the very beginning. It's not that you can grow up if you encounter setbacks, but that you will naturally encounter challenges when you are eager to grow. It is not that the event will come to you, but that you are in the event all the time. Don't hava a delusion of persecution, saying that life decives you, and you originally wrote the script yourself.

​	It has been quite difficult to manage my time properly over the past few days. What I really need to do is to strictly control my time. Getting up early is indeed a great habit. It should be uqite nice to wake up at 7:00 a.m. Another important aspect is managing screen time.

​	Big brother came back tody, but the time we spent together afterwards was a bit unpleasant. He doesn’t seem that interested in hearing me talk about the things I know more about than he does. I’m not sure if it’s because he’s worried about something. How should I put it? This feeling isn’t very good. It really shows that he lacks an open mind. It’s not very easy to communicate with him. It’s hard to say anything, and there’s no need to worry too much.

​	The learning of English still needs to continue. It is clear that learning through Zhu Wei’s classes is the simplest and most efficient way.

​	The most important things for a person: time, energy, and health. Stay away from lowbrow interests, time should not be wasted on meaningless things. Time is a limited resource. Focusing time on one task brings greater benefits. Those who know how to rest are often the ones who can work well.

  I’ve beem listening to 《The Corage to Be Disliked》 recently, and it’s truly a highly recommended book. It made me relize that everything that happened in the past only doesn’t determine the present, but also doesn’t dictate future. What matters is the meaning we assign to things. Leaning to practce task separation means not interfering other’tashs, nor allowing yourself to be influenced by them.

It’s like the saying:”You can lead horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.”

​	The Pomodora Technique is really necessary; it doesn’t limit us but rather enables us to learn more persistently while reducing harmful factors, such ad prolonged sitting, eye strain, and hearing loss. I only need to focus on tasks that can be completed within 25 minutes.

​	The sudden realization of how low my productivity actually is hits me. It fells like I’ve been immersed in a sense of being productive, but in reality, it’s not the case. Now reflecting on the day: I started as usual with my English studies, followed by learing a bit of Git syntax. Then I listend to an audiobook, watched some videos, taought my girlfriend some Python, and spent some time on various small, miscellaneous tasks. It feels like I’ve been immersed in this state for quite a long time. After finishing my English study, the time I actully spend on computer science has been very little, and even that time is quite unproductive. I actually became aware of this state a long time ago, but I subconsciously ignored it. Now, I want to address ang resolve it. I know that if I leave it unchecked, it’ll end up like when I tried to self-study high shool math-learning very little in the end. I still believe in that saying: when you know exactly where the problem lies, you’ve already solved half of it. The rest is simply about continuously improving and iterating on the foundation you’ve built. This also means that the beginning doesn’t have to be spectaculat---What matters most is taking action.

​	First and foremost, it’s definitely worth acknowledging that I’ve come to solid realization: the break time during a Pomadora session is actually meant to help me have more energy for the next round, rather than being a waste of time. On the contrary, it provides me with better focus and energy to face both life and learning.

​	I want to make my tasks more concrete, similar to how I approache English learning--having something speciic and actionable waiting to be done. It’s truly a great feeling, as it allows me to facus on what needs to be completed reather than being overwhelmed by an endless list of tasks.
